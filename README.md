# AUC Library Facial Recognition Tool

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an image face tagging tool. The tool allows users to tag individual faces in a set of images and manage these tags effectively.

## Upcoming Features

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A user-friendly interface for tagging faces in images.
2. **Metadata Storage**: Save identifications in separate metadata files for each image.
3. **Tag Cascading**: Automatically apply tags to all other images in the collection where the same face appears.
